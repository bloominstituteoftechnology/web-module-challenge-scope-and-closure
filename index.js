/**Example Task : processFirstItem()
 * This example shows how you might go about solving the rest of the tasks
 * 
 * Use the higher order function processFirstItem below to do the following:
 *  1. Receive an array of strings in a parameter
 *  2. Receive a callback function that takes a string as its argument in a parameter
 *  3. Return the result of invoking the callback function and passing in the FIRST 
 *     element in the array as the argument
 * 
 * The following code is demonstrating a way of completing this task
 * It returns the string `foofoo`

/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below. /*
  
/*   1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2? */
//? task 1.1: Counter 1 - the var count is not accessible outside the counter function; the counter function result is only available when countMaker runs; the function counter will begin at 0 each time the whole function countMaker is run; Counter 2 - the var count is accessible anywhere the script lives; when the function count2 is run, it will be giving incorrect information depending on where it lives as it is not reset to 0 each time it is accessed for a particular purpose");
  
/*  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell? */
//? task 1.2: Counter1 uses a closer, because the function counter is inside the countMaker function, making it inaccessible to any other function, even when it is returned. The returned value can only be accessed within the countMaker function, therefore it is closed to other functions that reside in the same place");

/* 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? */
//? task 1.3:', "If there is more than one function within a program that needs to access this counter function, counter1 is better");

//! *****QUESTION FOR CLASS******  will this initiate a new 0 start each time an individual function outside of counterMaker calls it

Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2

Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2",
