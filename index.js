/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
      counter1 defines the variable 'count' within the function, making that variable only accessable within the function. 
      counter2, on the other hand, defines the 'count' variable in the global space, making that variable accessable to all code
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
      Both functions use closure, because both are referancing variables outside of the local scope of a function. For counter 1, 
      the embeded function 'counter()' is referancing the variable 'count', which exists within the 'counterMaker()' function but outside
      of the 'counter()' function. for counter 2, the function is referancing the variable 'count', which exists outside of the function
      and within the global space.
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  
      counter1 is preferable when one wants to run the counterMaker function without forever changing the count variable. one can create
      a variable that set equal to the 'counter()' function, which will effectively change the 'count' variable as it relates to the 'counter 1'
      variable seen below, but the original function stays in tact with a count of 0. This would be useful if one wanted to create multiple 
      counters without making new functions. 
      Using the counter 2 function will change the count variable every time the function is called. It would be useful if one only 
      wanted to know how many times the function was called, and did not have any need for multiple different counts.*/

// counter1 code
function counterMaker() {
  let count = 0;
  return function counter() {
   return count++;
  }
}

const counter1 = counterMaker();

// counter2 code
let count = 0;

function counter2() {
  return count++;
}


/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 2: inning() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 3: finalScore() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 4: getInningScore() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the getInningScore() function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a callback function - you will pass in the inning function from task 2 as your argument 
  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function */

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
